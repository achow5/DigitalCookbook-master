Module tested: Text To Speech

The on screen buttons should track the current step the user is on.
if there are no previous steps, the back button should not do anything.
if there are no next steps, the forward button should not do anything.
the buttons will read out the correct step until it is completed,
or another useful button is pressed.
 

Equivalence classes:

Since the data structure is the same for all recipes, 
testing all 3 buttons thoroughly for a single recipe with more than one step
should be sufficient to ensure the fuctionality of text to speech for all recipes.

Test Cases:
1. Select a recipe with more than one step.

2. Press the middle button to start reading the first step.

3. Before the step has finished reading, press the back button. 
   No interuptions should happen.

4. Let the step finish, then press the middle button again.

5. While the step is still being read, press the forward button. 
   The speech should stop, and start the next step.

6. Go to the last step, play it, and then press the forward button.
   No interuptions should happen.
