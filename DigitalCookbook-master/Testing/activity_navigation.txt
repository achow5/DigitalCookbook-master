Module tested: Activity navigation

We have multiple categories that a user could select. Each of these
categories should lead to a list of recipes that are under that
category. When a recipe is selected from that list, it should lead
to a full recipe page that shows everything needed to make that
recipe. 


Equivalence classes: 

We have a large number of recipes contained in each category. If we 
get the desired output from selecting one recipe in the list, then 
all of the recipes for that category should also result in the desired 
output.

Test Case:

1. Select a category
2. Verify the picture next to a chosen recipe is correct
3. Select the chosen recipe
4. Verify that the correct data is displayed
5. Return to the main menu using in app navigation buttons
6. Repeat for all categories
